# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 1 - Exploring Weather Trends

## Overview
The first project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program asks students to analyze local global temperature data and then compare the temperature trends where he or she lives with those of the entire planet. 

For this project, I selected a subset of data from the provided resource for Atlanta, Georgia--the closest metropolitan area to where I live.
